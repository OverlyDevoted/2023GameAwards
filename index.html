                <h2>Accomplishement evidentiary material 🎮</h2>
                <p>As a seasoned gamer of games, I have decided to create this page as a showcase to my great
                    accomplishements in hopes that it brings joy and new-found perpective to those in great need. I know
                    that times have not been too kind, but we all can say that gaming has helped our lives. The small
                    ones, the big ones... We all can find something that let's us express ourselves, let's us take a
                    break
                    from our daily burdens. </p>
                <p>Unfortunentely, this was not a great gaming year for me... I have forgone a trechous path of
                    finishing
                    university, looking for jobs (to no success), passing car technical inspections,
                    starting nummerous programming courses and in the face of all those challenges I'm happy that I was
                    able
                    to enjoy what I love most just even just for a little.</p>
                </p>
                <p>With this, I would like to present you with my gaming accomplishements for 2023.</p>

                        <p>It would be rude of me not to mention that this would not be possible without my gaming

                            the level of participating at eSports Olympics for this year, I'm glad I get to play with

                        <p>After writing bachelors thesis for numerous hours this was the game that kept me up at night.
                            Every run I played was on Monsoon, and throught all the runs I have done, I managed to only
                            beat
                            Monsoon on <span style="color: greenyellow;">Engineer</span> and <span

                        <p>The last major Minecraft addiction was last year when I made <em>Out of stock</em>. Before
                            and
                            while in the production of that video, I spent numerous hours grinding at my automated mud
                            farm
                            and plant processing factory. I'm pretty sure the mud farm is broken now, because while
                            trying
                            to showcase it I spilled water over redstone. But hey, it was fun while it lasted. I hope I
                            can
                            get addicted to Minecraft this year again, as that addiction brings out much creativity and
                            feeling of belonging....</p>

                    <p>This award is given to a game that I tried to play, but never got too invested into. By no means
                        it's
                        a bad game, I would love to try again and understand it better, but it's just all too
                        overwhelming... I'm sorry to this game, maybe I just need a multiplayer buddy for this one, but
                        it's...</p>

                    <p>And now for the big guy. Ok, this game did not bring me much joy, this game makes me mad every
                        time I
                        play it, I never want to play it. But when I do play and I do well, it feels like I'm GOD. I
                        never
                        expected I would ever make this my game of the year, but here we go... <span
