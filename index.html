            <h2>Accomplishement evidentiary material üéÆ</h2>
            <p>As a seasoned gamer of games, I have decided to create this page as a showcase to my great
                accomplishements in hopes that it brings joy and new-found perpective to those in great need. I know
                that times have not been too kind, but we all can say that gaming has helped with our lives. The small
                ones, the big ones... We all can find something that let's us express ourselves, let's us take a break
                from our daily burdens. </p>
            <p>Unfortunentely, this was not a great gaming year for me... I have forgone a trechous path of finishing
                university, looking for jobs (to no success), passing car technical inspections,
                starting nummerous programming courses and in the face of all those challenges I'm happy that I was able
                to enjoy what I love most just even just for a little.</p>
            </p>
            <p>With this, I would like to present you with my gaming accomplishements for 2023.</p>

                    <p>It would be rude of me not to mention that this would not be possible without my gaming partner
                        <span style="color:palevioletred">Bubblewrapped</span>. Me and this guy showed up consistently
                        and it's incredible how much we had improved over the years. Though we never managed to grind to
                        the level of participating at eSports Olympics for this year, I'm glad I get to play with this
                        guy.

                    <p>After writing bachelors thesis for numerous hours this was the game that kept me up at night.
                        Every run I played was on Monsoon, and throught all the runs I have done, I managed to only beat
                        Monsoon on <span style="color: greenyellow;">Engineer</span> and <span
                            style="color: orange;">MULT-T</span>. I know I suck at this game, but I still love it. üß°

                    <p>The last major Minecraft addiction was last year when I made <em>Out of stock</em>. Before and
                        while in the production of that video, I spent numerous hours grinding at my automated mud farm
                        and plant processing factory. I'm pretty sure the mud farm is broken now, because while trying
                        to showcase it I spilled water over redstone. But hey, it was fun while it lasted. I hope I can
                        get addicted to Minecraft this year again, as that addiction brings out much creativity and
                        feeling of belonging....</p>

                <p>This award is given to a game that I tried to play, but never got too invested into. By no means it's
                    a bad game, I would love to try again and understand it better, but it's just all too
                    overwhelming... I'm sorry to this game, maybe I just need a multiplayer buddy for this one, but
                    it's...</p>

                <p>And now for the big guy. Ok, this game did not bring me much joy, this game makes me mad every time I
                    play it, I never want to play it. But when I do play and I do well, it feels like I'm GOD. I never
                    expected I would ever make this my game of the year, but here we go...</p>
