    <h1>Flex box is my favorite</h1>
    <!-- Through parent we control the placement of it's children element. But not grandchildren -->
    <!-- If flex container contains children in one column that are larger than parent it will nowrap and try to fit the children into the row or column reducing their content size -->
    <!-- Shorthand properties are properties that let you define a couple of properties using one. So flex-flow let's you define flex-direction and flex-wrap   -->
    <!-- Main axis and helper axis. Main axis is the flex-direction axis -->
    <!-- flex is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-base -->
    <!-- align-self child can align itself -->
    <!-- with order we can order of flex items. If order is largest, the element is placed at the end, order of smallest, the element gets placed at the start.
    
    Order is usually used for responsive design
